Customer churn is a critical concern for banks and financial institutions, as retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Understanding the factors that lead to customer attrition enables banks to implement proactive strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). By analyzing historical data related to customer demographics, account information, and banking behavior, the model aims to identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

The dataset used includes features such as credit score, geography, age, tenure, balance, number of products, and whether the customer has an active credit card. The ANN is trained to learn complex relationships among these variables and classify customers as either likely to stay or churn.

Through this project, we aim to:

Develop a robust predictive model using ANN. Improve the bank's ability to retain customers by identifying churn risks early. Demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in customer behavior modeling.
